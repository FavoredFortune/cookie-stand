        <h1>More about our cookie origins</h1>
        <p>One day, quite by accident, while baking cookies for her friends, Pat put in ground salmon that she was preparing for that day's dinner, salmon cakes. </p>
        <p>Unkowningly Pat served the cookies to her friends and they all said they tasted better than usual. Pat wondered why, and reviewed her day's cookie and discovered her <em>wonderful</em> mistake. </p>
        <p>But this was just the beginning of these cookies!</p>
        <p>Over the ensuing months Pat spent every spare moment not with her childern, volunteering at their schools, at her job an elementary school teacher, or at her environmental salmon watch group, focused on perfecting these cookies. </p>
        <p>There was a lot of trial and error. Some cookies tasted too "fishy", others too salty. One of the key factors in finding the perfect balance? Pat's taste testers, her family!</p>

      <h1>More about Pat's family</h1>
      <img src="img/family.jpg" alt="Pat's loving and supportive family">
      <p>Pat has two children, Bobby and Sue, whom she raises with her husband Rick. The family started when Pat and Rick met at University of Puget Sound in the early 2000s.</p>
      <p> Rick is an architect and serious amature fly fisherman. He too volunteers at the same environmental salmon watch group as Pat. In fact, their romance started on a trip to protest oil shipping lanes in the Puget Sound. </p>
      <p>Since they first met, Rick has always been amazed at Pat's culinary prowess and fantastic baking skills. Rick loves bread baking and it is a shared passion of theirs. He was thrilled to try all 301 versions of the salmon cookie until Pat found just the right balance.</p>
      <p>Bobby, age 12, is a great soccer player, plays the trumpet and loves to hike. His active life style and growth made him a perfect customer to benefit from Pat's cookie health benefits. Bobby often takes a cookie with him to games and has an extra in his bag for a snack. He's a big fan of these cookies (and claims to hate fish!)</p>
      <p>Sue, age 9, has a green belt in Kung Fu, plays the violin and can usually be found on biking on weekends with friends and family. She does like fish, but the thought cookies sounded terrible. She's now one fo the cookies biggest fans.</p>
      <p>Starting a new business takes so much time and energy, but luckily Pat's whole family has been amazingly supportive of the venture. Without them, none of this would be possible. </p>
