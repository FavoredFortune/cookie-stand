        <h1>More about our cookie origins</h1>
        <p>One day, quite by accident, while baking cookies for her friends, Pat put in ground salmon that she was preparing for that day's dinner, salmon cakes. </p>
        <p>Unkowningly Pat served the cookies to her friends and they all said they tasted better than usual. Pat wondered why, and reviewed her day's cookie and discovered her <em>wonderful</em> mistake. </p>
        <p>But this was just the beginning of these cookies!</p>
        <p>Over the ensuing months Pat spent every spare moment not with her childern, volunteering at their schools, at her job as dental hygenist, or at her environmental salmon watch group, focused on perfecting these cookies. </p>
        <p>There was a lot of trial and error. Some cookies tasted too "fishy", others too salty. One of the key factors in finding the perfect balance? Pat's taste testers, her family!</p>
